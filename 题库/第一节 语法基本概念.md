7. Even as a girl, （  ） to be her life, and theater audiences were to be her best teachers.
A. performing by Melissa were 
B. it was known that Melissa's performances were 
C. knowing that Melissa's performances were 
D. Melissa knew that performing was
答案：D
解析：从Even as a girl可知本句主语应该是人，而后面有两个to be构成并列结构，只有D符合句式要求并且语法正确。A句中主语为performing，谓语为were，主谓不一致，属语法错误；C句中主语为knowing，谓语为were，也是主谓不一致；此外performing和knowing也都不可能作为a girl的逻辑主语。而B虽然语法正确，但主语是it，也不能作为as短语的逻辑主语。

10. Which of the following sentences is INCORRECT? （  ）
A. How strange feelings they are! 
B. How dare you speak to me like that! 
C. What noise they are making! 
D. What a mess we are in!
答案：A
解析：考查感叹句的构成。感叹句主要有两种：what(a/an)+a.+n. (+主语+谓语+其他成分)；how+a./ad. (+主语+谓语)。口语中还可用陈述句、祈使句、疑问句表达感叹，也可用how dare/dared(+主语+谓语)结构。B、C、D正确，A不正确，How后不能接名词词组strange feelings，可改成What strange feelings they are!
