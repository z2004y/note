2. The team can handle whatever 
    A. that needs handling 
    B. which needs handling 
    C. it needs handling 
    D. needs to be handled
答案：D
解析：whatever引导的名词性从句作动词handle的宾语，同时whatever在从句中作主语，whatever相当于anything that，故选项D正确。选项A、B、C中的that，which，it都是多余的。

3. Quality is _ counts most.
    A. which 
    B. that 
    C. what 
    D. where
答案：C

4. The government has promised to do _ lies in its power to ease the hardships of the victims in the flood-stricken area.
    A. however 
    B. whichever 
    C. whatever 
    D. wherever
答案：C
解析：本句需填入的连接词引导动词do的宾语从句，并在从句中充当主语成分。四个选项中只有B项whichever和C项whatever能引导名词性从句，但whichever一词强调“多个选择中的任何一个”，而这句话里并没有选择的含义；而whatever相当于anything that，符合题意。however用于引导方式状语从句，wherever引导地点状语从句，皆不正确。

5. After _ seemed an endless wait, it was her turn to enter the personnel manager's office.
    A. that 
    B. there 
    C. what 
    D. it
答案：C
解析：C项what在after后引导一个宾语从句，既作after的宾语，又充当从句中的主语。A项that不对，因为在宾语从句中，that只能连接从句，不能同时在从句中作主语。B项there与D项it皆不能作连接代词。

6. He's _ as a "bellyacher" - he's always complaining about something.
    A. who is known 
    B. whom is known 
    C. what is known 
    D. which is known
答案：C
解析：本句He's后为表语从句，其后的连接词既引导表语从句，又要在从句中作主语，只有what可以，what is known意为“所谓的，大家所知道的”。

7. She managed to save _ she could out of her wages to help her brother. 
    A. how little money 
    B. so little money 
    C. such little money 
    D. what little money
答案：D
解析：本句save后面为宾语从句，从句中could后事实上省略了重复的动词save，空格处在宾语从句中作宾语，因此需要用what引导。

8. There is no doubt _ the company has made the right decision on the sales project.
    A. why 
    B. that 
    C. whether 
    D. when
答案：B
解析：doubt在否定句中带同位语从句时，引导词通常是that，在肯定句中则一般用whether。本句是否定句(no doubt)，用连词that。
