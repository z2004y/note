1. I ____ the party much more if there hadn't been quite such a crowd of people there.
A. would enjoy
B. will have enjoyed
C. would have enjoyed
D. will be enjoying
答案：C
解析：本句含有if引导的条件句，从句中使用了hadn't been，是对过去情况的假设，因此主句的结构应为would have done，故答案为C。
2. If you explained the situation to your solicitor, he ____ able to advise you much better than I can.
A. would be
B. will have been
C. was
答案：A
解析：本题条件状语从句中的谓语动词用了过去式explained，说明其内容与现在或将来的情况相反，所以主句的谓语动词应该用“would + 动词原形”，答案为A。
3. If you ____ in such a hurry you ____ sugar into the sauce instead of salt.
A. were not, would not put
B. were, would put
C. had been, would have put
D. had not been, would not have put
答案：D
解析：题干中把糖放到酱汁里这个动作已经发生，因此本句是对过去情况的假设。if条件状语从句应使用had done，主句使用would/should/could have done。选项C和D在语法上都对，不过C用了肯定，表示“如果你匆忙，你会把糖当成盐放到酱汁里”，意思上不合逻辑，故D项正确。
4. ____ their help, we would not have succeeded.
A. Hadn't been for
B. Had it not been for
C. It hadn't been for
D. Had not it been for
答案：B
解析：本句是省略了if的虚拟条件句，原句的正常语序为：If it had not been for their help。省略时，只提前助动词，否定词not不用提前，即Had it not been for... 故答案为B。
5. She asked that she ____ allowed to see her son in police custody.
A. would be
B. could be
C. be
D. was
答案：C
解析：ask作“请求，要求”讲时，其后的宾语从句要用虚拟语气，从句谓语动词使用“(should +) 动词原形”。类似用法的动词还有demand、suggest、order、require、desire、surprise等等。
6. It is necessary that he ____ the assignment without delay.
A. hand in
B. hands in
C. must hand in
D. has to hand in
答案：A
解析：在“It is/was + 形容词 + that从句”中，that引导的主语从句谓语动词常用should + 动词原形。用于该句型的形容词有necessary、good、important、right、wrong、better、natural、proper、funny、strange、surprising等。
7. It is absolutely essential that William ____ his study in spite of some learning difficulties.
A. will continue
B. continued
C. continue
D. continues
答案：C
解析：It is essential that... 句型中，that引导的从句用虚拟语气，谓语动词用“should + 动词原形”，should可以省略。故C为正确选项。类似的形容词还有important、necessary、imperative、advisable、desirable等。
8. If only I ____ play the guitar as well as you!
A. would
B. could
C. should
D. might
答案：B
解析：If only从语义和用法上都相当于I wish，后面的谓语动词用一般过去时表示目前的愿望，用过去完成时表示过去的愿望，用would/could do表示对将来期望。选项中首先可排除C和D。而A项would侧重指人的意愿，B项could是指人的能力。句子的意思主要是指弹吉他的能力，所以应该选择B。
9. ____ you further problems with your printer, contact your dealer for advice.
A. If, had
B. Have, had
C. Should, have
D. In case, had
答案：C
解析：本句的主句使用了祈使句，而非虚拟，因此从句应理解成对真实情形的一种假设。A项使用一般过去时，是对现在或将来情况的虚拟，而真实条件句应使用一般现在时表示将来，所以A不正确，应该使用if you have...  B和C都省略了if，B项have had是对过去情况的虚拟，不正确；C项中的should用在假设句中，加强语气，should have是对将来情况的假设，故C为正确答案；D项In case“万一，以防”引导的从句使用一般现在时或should + 动词原形，不能用had。
10. It was recommended that passengers ____ smoke during the flight.
A. not
B. need not
C. could not
D. would not
答案：A
解析：It is recommended that...表明that从句需要使用虚拟语气，其形式为“should + 动词原形”，其中should可以省略，故答案为A。
11. If you have really been studying English for so long, it's about time you ____ able to write letters in English.
A. should be
B. were
C. must be
D. are
答案：B
解析：it is (about) time (that)是一个虚拟语气句型，所跟从句的谓语动词用一般过去式，故B项were为答案。
12. I was to have made a speech if ____.
A. I was not called away
B. nobody would have called me away
C. I had not been called away
D. nobody called me away
答案：C
解析：was/were to have done sth.表示“本来要做......”，表与过去事实相反，从句谓语动词应使用had done，所以应选C。
13. It's getting late, I'd rather you ____ now.
A. left
B. leave
C. are leaving
D. will leave
答案：A
解析：would rather“宁愿”后接从句时，从句动词用一般过去式表虚拟，故答案为A。注意区分would rather其他两个惯用句式：would rather do sth. “宁愿做某事”；would rather do... than do... “宁愿做……而不愿做……”。
14. It's high time we ____ cutting down the rainforests.
A. stopped
B. had to stop
C. shall stop
D. stop
答案：A
解析：It is (high) time (that)后面的从句谓语动词要用过去式或“should + 动词原形”，且should不可省略，故A项stopped为答案。B项had to stop表示“一定要停止”，C项是将来时，D项动词原形，都不符合条件。
15. If only the patient ____ a different treatment instead of using the antibiotics, he might still be alive now.
A. had received
B. received
C. should receive
D. were receiving
答案：A
解析：if only常常用来表达强烈的愿望或遗憾，由于“接受不同的治疗”与过去事实相反，所以用过去完成时，故A项had received正确。
