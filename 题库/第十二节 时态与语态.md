1. In his plays Shakespeare ____ his characters live through their language.
A. would make
B. had made
C. made
D. makes
答案：D
解析：本句描述的是莎翁的戏剧，虽然“使人物生动”的行为动作发生在过去，但说的是莎翁的写作风格、特点，表示不受时间限制的客观存在，因此用一般现在时。故选D。
2. I ____ writing the paper as scheduled, but my mother's illness interfered. I hope you will excuse me.
A. am to have finished
B. was to have finished
C. was to finish
D. ought to finish
答案：B
解析：be to do表示已经计划好，马上要做的事情，be to have done本应该做某事（而没有做）。根据but分句所使用的一般过去时可知，本句的动作发生在过去，故用B项was to have finished。
3. How can I ever concentrate if you ____ constantly ____ me with silly questions.
A. have; interrupted
B. had; interrupted
C. are; interrupting
D. were; interrupting
答案：C
解析：constantly表明动作经常发生，现在进行时可表示经常发生的事情，表示不满或抱怨情绪，故选项C正确。
4. For some time now, world leaders ____ out the necessity for agreement on arms reduction.
A. had been pointing
B. have been pointing
C. were pointing
D. pointed
答案：B
解析：本句中的时间状语是for some time now，既表示过去到现在的一段时间，又包括现在阶段，所以应该选择现在完成进行时，表示动作从过去持续到现在并仍在进行。
5. "It seems that she was there at the conference." The sentence means that ____.
A. she seems to be there at the conference.
B. she seemed to be there at the conference.
C. she seems to have been there at the conference.
D. she seemed to being there at the conference
答案：C
解析：题干中的“it seems that...”是一般现在时，表示在说话时“看来似乎/好像是”；that从句中用的是一般过去时，表示“她出席会议”是过去的事件。整句话表示现在做出的对过去某事的判断。四个选项中，B、D用了一般过去时，时态不对；A没有表示“过去”的语法手段，也不对；C项中的不定式用了完成体，表示过去时间，语义与题干中的句子完全一致，为答案。
6. The committee has anticipated the problems that ____ in the road construction project.
A. arise
B. will arise
C. arose
D. have arisen
答案：B
解析：主句中的动词has anticipated为现在完成时的“已完成”用法，表示“已经预见到了”，强调现在的状态，因此定语从句中应该用将来时以表示“(现在预见到)某事将要发生”，因此B为正确选项。
7. He would have finished his college education, but he ____ to quit and find a job to support his family.
A. had had
B. has
C. had
D. would have
答案：C
解析：他辍学是真的，此处是陈述事实，而且动作已经发生，所以用一般过去时。has to的过去时是had to，没有过去完成时had had to这种说法，故选C。
8. James has just arrived, but I didn't know he ____.
A. will come
B. was coming
C. had been coming
D. came
答案：B
解析：本句是在过去时间里(昨天)看将来动作(詹姆斯要来)，应该用过去将来时。因为come/go/leave一类动词的进行时可以表将来，was coming表达的就是过去将来时，因此B是正确答案。C项had been coming是过去完成进行时，表达的意思是“来”这个动作一直持续到昨天，与逻辑不合。
9. ____ conscious of my moral obligations as a citizen.
A. I was and always will be
B. I have to be and always will be
C. I had been and always will be
D. I have been and always will be
答案：D
解析：本句是一般性的陈述，没有理由用过去时或过去完成时，故排除A和C。选项B中的have to“不得不”表达的是被迫、不情愿的意思，与句子正面、肯定的意思相反。只有D正确地表达了说话者的观念持续到现在并将延续到将来的意思。
10. Jack ____ from home for two days now, and I am beginning to worry about his safety.
A. has been missing
B. has been missed
C. had been missing
D. was missed
答案：A
解析：由句中的时间状语for two days now可确定用现在完成时，而表示“失踪的”应该用missing，而不是missed“被错过的”，因此选项A正确。
11. Come and see me whenever ____.
A. you are convenient
B. you will be convenient
C. it is convenient to you
D. it will be convenient to you
答案：C
解析：主句用祈使句表达将来的概念，whenever引导的状语从句用一般用现在时表将来，先排除B和D。表示“你方便”用it is convenient to you，而不是you are convenient，故答案为C。
12. Mr.White works with a chemicals import & export company, but he ____ for this industrial fair, since he is on leave.
A. has worked
B. works
C. has been working
D. is working
答案：D
解析：从句意来看，怀特先生并不是工业交易会的长期雇员，所以不能用一般现在时；此外他正在休假期间，所以才有空做其他工作，所以包含过去含义的现在完成时和现在完成进行时都不合适；现在进行时与“在休假期间”相吻合，所以D为正确选项。
13. Professor Johnson is said ____ some significant advance in his research in the past year.
A. having made
B. making
C. to have made
D. to make
答案：C
解析：is said后跟不定式，不能跟动词-ing形式，排除A和B。从句中的时间状语in the past year可以看出动作已经发生并完成。C项to have made是不定式的完成式，表示动作发生在谓语动词之前，而D项to make表示动作没有发生，故C项正确。
