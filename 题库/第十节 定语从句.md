1. I was very interested in ____ she told me.
A. all that
B. all which
C. all what
D. that
答案：A
解析：all作为先行词，指代“she told me”的内容。当all作先行词时，只可以与关系代词that搭配使用，all that等于what。句中介词in后面不能接that引导的宾语从句，故D错 。

2. The party, ____ I was the guest of honour, was extremely enjoyable.
A. by which
B. for which
C. to which
D. at which
答案：D
解析：可将先行词和定语从句还原为“I was the guest of honor at the party”，“在晚会上”需用介词at，所以选D。

3. He is quite worn out from years of hard work. He is not the man ____ he was twenty years ago.
A. which
B. that
C. who
D. whom
答案：B
解析：需填入的连词既要连接定语从句“he was twenty years ago”，又要作从句中的表语（或主语补语），只有B项that符合要求。who通常在引导定语从句时作主语或宾语，whom一般作从句中的宾语，因此C和D不可选，which不引导修饰人的定语从句，在此处不合适。

4. Have you ever been in a situation ____ you know the other person is right yet you cannot agree with him?
A. by which
B. for which
C. in where
D. where
答案：D
解析：关系副词where在此句中引导定语从句修饰先行词situation，相当于in which，故选项D正确。

5. We've just installed two air - conditioners in our apartment, ____ should make great differences in our life next summer.
A. which
B. what
C. that
D. they
答案：A
解析：逗号后是非限制性定语从句，需要填入引导词。A项which正确，B项what和C项that不能引导非限制性定语从句，D项they能充当后一分句的主语，但两个分句间无连词，语法不正确。

6. Above the trees are the hills, ____ magnificence the river faithfully reflects on the surface.
A. where
B. of whose
C. whose
D. which
答案：C
解析：逗号后面的部分为非限制性定语从句，关系代词在从句中充当定语，其先行词为hills，且the hills和magnificence是从属关系，所以本题应选C项whose。

7. The physicist has made a discovery, ____ of great importance to the progress of science and technology.
A. I think which is
B. that I think is
C. which I think is
D. which I think it is
答案：C
解析：逗号后为非限制性定语从句，修饰a discovery，用which连接，I think可视作插入语。引导词which在从句中可充当句子成分，D项中的it多余；that不能引导非限制性定语从句，B不正确。

8. I have never been to London, but that is the city ____.
A. where I like to visit most
B. I'd most like to visit
C. which I like to visit mostly
D. where I'd like most to visit
答案：B
解析：本句需填入修饰the city的定语从句，先行词city在从句中作visit的宾语，引导词可用that、which或省略。B项省略了引导词，为答案。where是关系副词，不能在定语从句中充当宾语，所以A和D错误；C项中的mostly表示“主要地，大部分，通常”，不合句意，应改为most才对。

9. Firms that use computers have found that the number of staff ____ is needed for quality control can be substantially reduced.
A. whose
B. as
C. what
D. that
答案：D
解析：题中修饰staff的定语从句中缺少主语，D项that既可连接定语从句，又可充当从句中的主语，用来指人，符合题意。
